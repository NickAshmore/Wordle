Front end:

&nbsp;	HTML: structure - "there is a button"

&nbsp;	JavaScript: behavior - "When the button is clicked, do this"

&nbsp;	CSS: visual - "the button is blue"



Back end (runs on a server):

&nbsp;	*Backend listens for requests and sends responses*

		*- Button clicks*

		*- form submits*

		*- returns data or HTML*

	*Think of the backend like main() but instead of stdin/stdout, it uses HTTP requests/responses*

	

	Python + Flask -> when someone goes to /status, run this function



HTTP:

&nbsp;	Glue between frontend and backend

&nbsp;	Browser sends request, backend sends response

&nbsp;	We don't implement HTTP, we use libraries



Data storage:

&nbsp;	Databases, SQLite database, files



Dev tools:

&nbsp;	Interpreter / runtime (Python, node)

&nbsp;		- like a compiler, but built in?

&nbsp;	Package manager (pip, npm)

&nbsp;	Editor (VSCode)

&nbsp;	Terminal

&nbsp;
